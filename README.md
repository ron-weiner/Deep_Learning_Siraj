# Deep_Learning_Siraj
The whole "Intro to deep Learning" YouTube course of Siraj Raval.
I used python 3.6 using jupyter notebook over anaconda, core i3 with no gpu (that's why i got poor results for some tasks, I was focused on making it work and not achieving the ideal result...)

Most of the code here was not written by me, credit to siraj / weekly wizards :)

Some of the errors remained unsolved but the point is clear enough..
